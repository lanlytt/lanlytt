Drawing is one of my main interests, and I'm currently learning sketching and digital drawing with a tablet. My profile picture "Kaosu" (favorite one) is illustrated by [Shirabe Tsukiyama][shirabe]，authorized.

Drawn to J-pop songs and Japanese-style illustrations, I'm actively studying Japanese. Many thanks to all those Japanese pals who helped me. 一人一人、全員に感謝しています。
