Hi, this is Little Lan. This website is where I write about my personal growth. While I usually read documents in English, writing is still challenging for me. I will strive to be vigilant in avoiding grammatical errors.

Drawn to J-pop songs and Japanese-style illustrations, I'm actively studying Japanese. Many thanks to all those Japanese pals who helped me. 一人一人、全員に感謝しています。
